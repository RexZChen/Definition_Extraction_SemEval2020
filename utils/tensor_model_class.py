"""
This file is the interface class for model
You just simply pass your model and your data_loader and we will take care anything else
Including:
train (and also train_val split), test, recording the loss and validation results, plotting, saving checkpoints, etc

Note: it's an abstract class and you can extend it to a pytorch model or tensorflow/keras model, etc

    This class is an interface for all kinds of deep learning models.
    The design purpose for this is that we have different dl framework,
    so people may build a same model in different ways (some choose pytorch and others choose keras).
    They are in common in some properties and different in other aspects.
    So this interface class provides some basic common properties that you need after you
    handcraft a deep learning model and wants to train and test this model
